# Three.js implementation of an occlusion-aware 3D visualisation

Will also be configurable with gaze awareness (somehow). 

### Running the application

* ~~Run `npm install` to install dependencies.~~
* ~~Run `npm start` to start running the local server at http://localhost:5173/~~

* This version is hacked together to not require npm packages. Use e.g. vite (`npm install vite --save-dev`) to run it locally with CORS working. 
* Using vite, run `npx vite` to run the page locally.
